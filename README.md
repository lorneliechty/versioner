versioner
=========

Super simple web api for maintaining a central repository of version numbers. Coordinating incremental build version
numbers across a small team can sometimes be a pain for simple automation scripts. Ideally the build version number
would be requested from a central repository that will always provide a new, incremental number. This project aims
to provide that simple service.
